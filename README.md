## Introduction

The COVID-19 Vaccination System aims to streamline the vaccination process, making it easier for individuals to register, schedule appointments, and for health authorities to manage vaccine distribution efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for both administrators and users to navigate the vaccination process.

## Features

### 1. User Registration and Authentication
- Allows users to create accounts for scheduling vaccination appointments.
- Provides secure login functionality to protect user data.

### 2. Appointment Scheduling
- Users can view available time slots and schedule vaccination appointments accordingly.
- Automated confirmation and reminders sent to users about their appointments.

### 3. Vaccine Inventory Management
- Tracks current vaccine inventory levels.
- Sends alerts when stocks are low to ensure timely replenishment.

### 4. Vaccination Tracking
- Records individual vaccination statuses, including first and second doses.
- Tracks the progress of vaccination across different demographics.

### 5. Reporting
- Generates detailed reports on vaccination statistics, such as doses administered and demographic breakdowns.
- Provides insights for decision-making and resource allocation.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: Django (for backend development)
- **Database**: MySQL (for data storage and management)
- **Frontend Design**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for user interface development)

## Requirements

### Software
- Python 3.x
- Django (version 3.0 or higher)
- MySQL (version 5.7 or higher)
- A modern web browser

### Hardware
- Any computer capable of running Django and a MySQL server.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure MySQL Database**:
   - Create a new MySQL database and user.
   - Update the `settings.py` file in your Django project with the database connection details:
     ```python
     DATABASES = {
         'default': {
             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
             'NAME': 'yourdbname',
             'USER': 'yourusername',
             'PASSWORD': 'yourpassword',
             'HOST': 'localhost',
             'PORT': '3306',
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a Superuser** (for admin access):
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. **Access the Application**:
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage

1. **User Registration**:
   - Users can register for an account through the registration page.

2. **Appointment Scheduling**:
   - After logging in, users can view available time slots and schedule their vaccination appointments.

3. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Admins can log in using superuser credentials to manage vaccine inventory, view vaccination progress, and generate reports.

## Future Enhancements

- **Notification System**: Implement email or SMS notifications for appointment reminders and updates.
- **Mobile Application**: Develop a mobile app for easier access to the vaccination system.
- **User Feedback System**: Allow users to provide feedback on their vaccination experience.
- **Integration with Health Systems**: Enable data sharing with national health systems for better tracking and resource allocation.
